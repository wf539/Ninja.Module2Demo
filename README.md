If you are new to Entity Framework, Microsoft’s framework for integrating data access into your .NET applications, this is the place to start. You will gain an understanding of what EF is for, how it works, where it belongs in your software architecture, and how to get it there. You’ll gain hands on experience with the basics of using EF from designing a simple model to interacting with that to persist data from your application. In addition to getting developers started with EF and prepared to learn and take advantage of more advanced techniques, this course will provide managers with the info they need to help them with decision making when planning a development stack. We’ll be using Visual Studio 2015 and .NET 4.6 for demos.
